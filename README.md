# LALSuite installer

This bash script will (re)install the LSC Algorithm Library suite [(LALSuite)](https://wiki.ligo.org/DASWG/LALSuite)
(a suite of software for gravitational wave data analysis). It assumes that LALSuite has been
cloned from the [git repository](https://wiki.ligo.org/DASWG/LALSuite#Git_Repository).

The install will be within a [Virtual Environment](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) (and requires [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to be installed)
based on the git branch name.
